Procedure:
1. Connections are made as per the schematic connection diagram. 
2. The PID output is connected with the first order system and with unit feedback input.
3. Apply a DC input signal ranging from 0 to 5 V.
4. Now connect using patch cord for the input and set the desired input voltage Vin.
5. Now connect using patch cord for viewing the output.
6. Set the constants Kp, Ki and Kd values. 
7. Set I and D ‘OFF’ for P controller, D ‘OFF’ for PI controller and all kept ON (P I and D) for PID 
8. Observe the output voltage, Vout at time t = 10 sec and tabulate the readings of the output voltage.
9. Plot the graph between input voltage and output voltage
